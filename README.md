# ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬ Protein 2D Structure Prediction Using Deep Learning

*A deep learning pipeline for per-residue protein secondary structure classification (H, C, B) from FASTA sequences, featuring Conv1D architectures, automatic GIF visualization of weight updates, and evaluation plots.*

## 1. Problem Statement

Understanding a proteinâ€™s **secondary structure** (2D structure: Î±-helices, Î²-strands, coils) from its amino acid sequence is fundamental in computational biology.  
Traditional experimental methods (e.g., X-ray crystallography, NMR) are accurate but **expensive and time-consuming**.

This project implements a **fully automated deep learning workflow** to:
- Encode protein sequences from **FASTA** format.
- Map secondary structure labels from `.ss2` files (H, C, B).
- Train a Conv1D neural network for **per-residue classification**.
- Generate **training and validation curves**.
- Visualize **layer weight updates** over time via GIFs.

## 2. The Data: From Raw to Encoded

Data is sourced from **NCBI** for sequences and from **PSIPRED/DSSP** for secondary structure annotations.

- **Raw Data:** Located in `/data/raw/`  
  - `sequences.fasta` â†’ amino acid sequences.  
  - `<sequence_id>.ss2` â†’ per-residue secondary structure labels.

- **Data Processing:**
  - One-hot encoding over 20 canonical amino acids.
  - Mapping: `H` â†’ 0, `C` â†’ 1, `E` â†’ `B` (2).
  - Padding sequences to the maximum length in the dataset.

- **Final Encoded Data:** Arrays ready for deep learning are generated in memory (optional save to `/data/processed/`).

## 4. Workflow & Key Steps

### 4.1. Preprocessing
- Load sequences and labels.
- One-hot encode amino acids.
- Align sequence lengths with padding.
- Train/validation/test split.

### 4.2. Model Development
- Conv1D layers to capture local residue patterns.
- Dropout for regularization.
- Softmax output for per-residue classification into H, C, B.

### 4.3. Training & Tracking
- Loss: **categorical cross-entropy**
- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Metrics: Accuracy
- **Custom callback** (`Conv1DFilterLinesCallback`) to:
  - Track filter L2 norms and Î”W norms each epoch.
  - Save per-epoch PNG plots.
  - Create GIF animations of weight evolution.

### 4.4. Evaluation
- Generate loss and accuracy curves.
- Compute confusion matrix and classification report.
- Save all outputs to `outputs/` directory.
